# Baymax
## Personal Pentest Reporting Companion

Sorry this is still a WIP

Baymax can generate reports from your pentest data. So long as you follow a few conventions, that are poorly documented in the script.

```
baymax ./sample_op/
```

This will create ./sample_op/report/, it will also delete it before trying to create it, so dont put anything in there!

Here is a [Sample PDF](/sample_op/report/dist/final-exercise-report.pdf)

The templates are from the [OSCP Sample report](https://www.offensive-security.com/reports/sample-penetration-testing-report.pdf)

Hopefully this helpful to others

I used firefox to print to pdf since it was the prettiest
